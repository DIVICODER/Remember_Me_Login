Login Page

Description
This is a simple login page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login page provides a form for users to enter their username/email and password to log in. It also includes an optional "Remember Me" checkbox that allows users to remember their login choice for future visits.

Features
Input fields for username/email and password.
Validation of input fields (username and password length).
"Remember Me" checkbox to remember the user's login choice.
Responsive design for different screen sizes.

How to Use
Clone the repository or download the HTML file directly.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter your username/email and password in the input fields.
Optionally, check the "Remember Me" checkbox if you want the login choice to be remembered.
Click the "Login" button to submit the form.

Form Validation
The username/email must be at least 3 characters long.
The password must be at least 6 characters long.

Remember Me Feature
The "Remember Me" checkbox allows users to store their login choice for future visits. If the checkbox is checked, the login choice will be saved as a cookie that expires after 30 days. If the checkbox is unchecked, the cookie will be removed.

Please note that this implementation is for demonstration purposes only and doesn't connect to any backend server. In a real-world application, the form data would be submitted to a server for further processing, such as authentication and user session management.
